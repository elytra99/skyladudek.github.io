In the GitHub pages home repository, it also contains this README file which will instruct you on how to host your own resume on GitHub pages with a Jekyll theme, write your resume in Markdown using Atom as a text editor, and format your Jekyll front matter.  

## Intended Audience

These instructions are for absolute beginners. You require no previous experience with Markdown, GitHub, Atom or Jekyll to be able to follow these instructions. 

### Prerequisites
In order to complete the described task you will need:

*   A working computer with Internet 

*   Atom (a text editor) installed on your computer

*   Your own GitHub Account 

### Instructions
#### Create your own Resume using Markdown

    * Use Markdown headers to make headers in your resume such as "Education", "Work Experience" etc.
    * Use Markdown lists to create a list of your skills.
    * You can insert Markdown links onto your resume since it will be published online.
